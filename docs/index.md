# Welcome to UNICEF INVENT’s documentation!
UNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection of children’s rights, to help meet their basic needs and to expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. Across 190 countries and territories, UNICEF work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone. With a fundamental mission to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, UNICEF is and has always been committed to saving lives of children and their mothers and to generating evidence to promote this work. UNICEF defines innovation as a new or significantly improved solution that contributes to progress for children and accelerates results for children or young people. It is about doing new things to solve problems and improve the lives of children around the world. It is about matching today’s challenges with tomorrow’s solutions. A recent review of innovation at UNICEF identified the potential for a global portfolio-based approach to improve the effectiveness of innovation efforts. This has resulted in the establishment of 9 global Innovation Portfolios, and the creation of INVENT, a digital platform that serves as an inventory of innovation initiatives across UNICEF. The Innovation Portfolios and INVENT platform are key pillars of UNICEF’s innovation strategy.
