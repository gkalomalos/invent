# Country maps

Maps in the project are displayed via components from the [Vue Leaflet](https://vue2-leaflet.netlify.app/) package.

Customized map components are in `@/components/map`.
For convenience, the `vue-leaflet` plugin registers the `leaflet` components globally with a little bit of customization.
